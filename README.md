# Robot_Navigation
A 2D Program that places random objects on screen and a robot has to find its way from the starting location to goal location.

### Current State
 The current state of this project only populates a board with obstacles and places starting and ending positions. 
 
### Future Goals
  Create a pathfinding algoritm using A* or dijkstra to lead the robot from its starting position to the finish.
